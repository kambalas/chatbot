# RAG Chatbot (Learning Project)

This project is a hands-on exploration of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** systems.

The goal is to learn how modern AI chatbots are built by combining:
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Vector databases & embeddings
- Semantic search and retrieval
- Prompting and response optimization

## What I’m Learning
- RAG fundamentals and architecture
- Document ingestion and chunking
- Vector search and similarity retrieval
- Context injection and hallucination reduction
- LLM behavior, limits, and trade-offs
